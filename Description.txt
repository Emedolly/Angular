Angular - target - 7th October 

Introduction 
What is angular UI framework by google and it is a component based fmk for building scalable app which is provided collection of libraries to cover features like routing forms (many enterprise applications use angular only)
Stable version v12 
To rewrite the angular fmk they used typescript 
Fmk vs libraries ( a fmk generally contains set of libraries ) and this can extend the frameworks ex: angular ,.net , Ionic ,expressJS
Libraries generally perform specific operation 
You can combine multiple libs to build apps 
Some examples are react,momentJs , loads
Features of angular : Template, Data binding, Forms, routing , observables, PWA(the application behaviour will decide on this )

Introduction to typescript :
strongly typed programming language 
Created and maintained by Microsoft (2011 around)
Superset of javascript
Compiles to javascript 
Supported by all major libraries and frameworks 
Javascript does not have any type safety so will use typescript for the program and then will compile to javascript 
ES2015 
Angular,expressJs, Vue can written in typescript 
Typescript has its own compiler which is tsc 
In Typescript types are stripped when your code is converted to JS 
Typescript code cannot directly run code in the browser need to use den Installing and creating first typescript program 
Install Node 
Use latest version of nodejs 
`npm init` to create a package.json
Install typescript `npm I typescript`
Initialise typescript
`tsc —init`
 Macintosh HD - 289.9 mb space is occupied
Node js V22.19.0 to/ user/local/bin/node
Npm v10.9.3 to ser/local/bin/npm

To check the version of node use 
-MacBook-Air Typescript % node -v
In windows $ node -v
1.Install package.json using npm int
Package.json will keep all the track of use and what and all installed in the workspace
Npm will use this file when our code is publishing into the web

Npm I typescript - will generate the node_modules folder where all the installed packages will be stored for the development purpose 

Now need typescript configuration file 
(Got many errors - just note it)
TARGET: es5 all the modern and old browsers
Module: where to run the code is decided whether its os/browser and all mostly It will commonjs

To compile a program use tsc command this will generate a js file with the same name as typescript
tsc —init => will create the tsconfig.json file
Tsc => this will compile the ts code and will generate the js file with the same name as typescript file

Folder structure : and file function :

1.node_modules : this is like your bin/ or nuget package cache 
This is where npm installs all the projects dependencies(libraries like typescript, angular,RxJS etc) and their dependencies. You should never commit this folder to source control like git because its huge and can be perfectly recreated by running npm install on the package.json 
2.Package.json -> this is project manifest and dependency list
It defines your project and lists all the dependencies, this is the most important file and must be committed to source control 
3.package-lock.json -> this ensures consistent installs
It locks down the exact versions of every dependency that was installed. This ensures that everyone on the team and your build server will get the identical version of every package preventing form it works on my machine bugs. Commit this to source control 
4.tsconfig.json - the typescript compiler configuration 
This tile tells the typescript compile how to do its job. Do you want it to be very strict ? What js version should it output(ES2015 .ES5)? Where should it Put the compiled .js files? This is where you set the rules 
5.datatypes.ts - my source code
6.datatypes.js and datatypes.jsmap: compiler output 
These are automatically generated by the tsc command 
.js- compiled javascript code which browser actually runs 
.js.map - a source map file. Which creates the bridge between the compiled .js file and the original .ts source file. This allows you to debug you ts code directly In the browser  developer tools, even though its running JS 
7.datatypes.d.ts and datatypes.d.ts.map : type declarations 
These are also generated by the tsc or by the compiler
.d.ts - a type declaration file. It contains only the type information from your .ts file(no actual code).its used for type checking when you use your code in other parts of your project.
.d.ts.map - a sprich map for the declaration file
8.test.js - a javascript file for testing normally 


Why angular needs all this 

.NET developer is monolithic ( vs ,ms build, .NET runtime )
Web front-end world is modular and uses many small focussed tools

Node.js -> similar to .NET Runtime/CLR. Its a JS runtime. It allows JS code to run on your OS. This allows to build powerful tools and servers with JS

Npm(Node package manager) -> similar to NuGet. Default package manager for node js. To download and manage all those external libraries your project needs. Npm install is like dot net add package or install package 

TypeScript -> similar to C#. A superset of JS that adds static types, classes, interfaces etc. You write in .ts(C#) AND it gets compiled to .js(IL/MSIL) so browsers can understand it. It catches errors at compile time making code more robust

Why does angular require nodejs?

Angular itself is a front end fmk that runs in the browser. However development process requires a powerful environment 
1.Development server: need a local web server(ng serve) to run and test app. This server is built with node.js
2.Build process: your typescript code,HTML,CSS need to be compiled, bundled and minified into efficient bundles for the browser. This process is handled by build tools(like webpack) that runs on node.js
3.Tooling: the angular CLI , linters, testing fmks etc are all applications written in JS/TS and run on nodejs

Short : 
You will write angular/typescript code for the browser, but you use node.js based tools on your development machine to build it 

*Check the physical notes upto this for better understanding (Angular)

Single Page Application: 
you can use modern frameworks like angular, React OR vue to create SPA
SPA does not make requests to server for every URL requests

These are all the bunch of js code which is ready to render what ever the info is required for that particular Page

How does angular helps with SPA:
Anagular has routing functionality to create SPA 
Angular also offers SSR(Server side rendering) which supports SPA
SSR is good for SEO's search enginer optimization otherwise use SPA

DataTypes :-
 Data types, type inference, Union and intersection types, Generics, literal types 

 ex: let name='Eme'
 typescript automatically knows this is string which is called as type inference

 ex:
 create a varaible and do uppercase 
 use tsc command to update the .js file and use node datatypes -> to see the output
node can be used to run the code locally to see the output 

number : 
let age: Number;

boolean:
In dot net default value for boolean is false but in js/ts if we just write let isvalid : boolean it will be undefined so make a default value for that 

array :
let emplist=[];

*when you are compiling the typescript code to javascript the type inference can be removed

enum :
let c: Color = Color.Blue;
when you compile this it will generate much lines of code which is not required for the production environment so use const so that enum will have the indexing which will take the respective value.
var Color;
(function (Color) {
    Color[Color["Red"] = 0] = "Red";
    Color[Color["Green"] = 1] = "Green";
    Color[Color["Blue"] = 2] = "Blue";
})(Color || (Color = {}));
let c = Color.Blue;
the above piece of code will get generated if we dont use const
const enum Color {
  Red,
  Green,
  Blue
}

let c: Color = Color.Blue; 
by using this we should not get any function code in JS only the let c=2 will get displayed for the production

Tuples:
Swapping of numbers can be done with the array also but it doesnot give any compile time error where as tuple can give in the typescript

Any :
we can use any type of assignemnt recommended dont use this because this might fail in the production
void :
it willl nort return anything so always use the datattype

Functions:
different ways to write function as business logic which can be reused 

GenericFunction:
